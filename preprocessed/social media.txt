Social networks problematic use Social networks  Attachment  Attachment anxiety  Attachment avoidance Systematic review  In 2020, social networking sites (SNSs) were used by 49% of the worldwide population, tripling their total user base in the last decade and growing from 970 million in 2010 to more than three billion users in 2020 (Clement, 2020). SNSs are web-based services that are structured around three central features. First, users can create a personal profile, public or semipublic, which contains self-descriptive information; second, lists of connections are shown, which represent the user’s online social connections and relations of varying strength and importance; third, rather than checking the users’ profiles for updated content, most SNSs are organized around a stream of frequently updated content, which is primarily populated by posts from one’s connections (Boyd & Ellison, 2007: Verduyn et al., 2017). Although Facebook remains the  E-mail addresses: alessandro.musetti@unipr.it (A. Musetti), tommaso.manari@unipr.it (T. Manari), joel.billieux@unil.ch (J.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to summarize research that examined the associations between problematic social networking sites use (PSNSU) and attachment-related phenomena among adolescents and adults. Records were included in the systematic review if they presented original data, assessed attachment and PSNSU, were published in peer-reviewed journals between 2004 and 2021 and were written in English. After duplicates removal, 373 studies were found eligible for scrutiny. Among the screened full texts, 32 articles met the eligibility criteria. The selected studies included a total of 16,938 participants. Findings from these studies highlighted that PSNSU is negatively associated with indicators of secure attachment and positively associated with indicators of attachment anxiety, whereas results regarding indicators of attachment avoidance were mixed. Furthermore, an analysis of mediators showed that the relationship between PSNU and attachment-related phenomena is affected by individual, interpersonal, and SNS-related variables. Future directions for research as well as implications for clinical practice are discussed.  most popular social networking platform, with 2.7 billion active users worldwide in 2020, an increasing number of people are moving to more recent platforms, such as Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter (Clement, 2020).  People may use SNSs for entertainment, to establish and maintain relationships, connect with others who share similar hobbies or interests, or fill up free time (Marino et al., 2016; Ryan et al., 2016). A number of studies have pointed out the potential benefits related to SNSs use (for a review, see Best et al., 2014). These include indirect positive effects on wellbeing through an increase in self-esteem and perceived social support, safe identity exploration, more opportunities for self-disclosure and positive social repercussions, such as wider social support (Ellison & Boyd, 2013; Gil de Ztiniga et al., 2017; Huang, 2016; Subrahmanyam et al., 2006; Verduyn et al., 2017). For example, a study by Burrow and Rainone (2017) showed that the number of “likes” individuals received on their Facebook profile picture was perceived as  positive feedback and was positively associated with self-esteem. Furthermore, time spent using SNSs was associated with the extension of social capital (i.e., the number of offline relationships), thus increasing the individual’s feeling of connectedness (Gil de Ztiniga et al., 2017; Verduyn et al., 2017). However, a minority of individuals use SNSs excessively and have difficulty controlling it (Banyai et al., 2017; Boer et al., 2020) - a pattern frequently described as “addictive” or “compulsive     Despite growing research in this field, there is currently no consensus on the conceptualization of addictive and compulsive behaviors related to SNSs (Carbonell & Panova, 2017; Fernandes et al., 2019; Rumpf et al., 2019). This is largely a consequence of the confusion about the definition of the broader phenomenon of problematic Internet use (Billieux, Schimmenti, et al., 2015; Kardefelt-Winther et al., 2017). A recent debate on the risk of “diagnostic inflation” pointed to the importance of having a clinically useful definition of problematic online behaviors (Starcevic et al., 2020). Numerous studies support the notion that the broad term “Internet addiction” may not be a unitary construct (e.g., Andreassen et al., 2016; Musetti et al, 2016a; Starcevic & Billieux, 2017) and that instead, it may refer to a spectrum of similar, yet distinct problematic behaviors associated with Internet use (Baggio et al., 2018). Moreover, the Internet may be regarded as a medium for problematic online behaviors, with the notion of an addiction “to the Internet” being untenable (Griffiths & Szabo, 2014; Perales et al., 2020).  In an attempt to overcome these limitations, Wegmann et al. (2022) proposed a multidimensional classification of problematic use of Internet activities, including problematic social networking sites use (PSNSU), based on four domains: a) number of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for addictive disorders (e.g., loss of control, tolerance and preoccupation) met; b) severity of functional impairment; c) underlying psychological factors and processes; d) time spent online. In the present systematic review, we endorsed this comprehensive approach to identification of PSNSU, as research has been disparate in its theoretical and methodological underpinnings.  A variety of risk and protective factors have been found to be associated with PSNSU. Available evidence suggests that they include both contextual factors (e.g., quality and quantity of online/offline social capital, use of social networks in the family environment; Ruggieri et al., 2020) and individual factors (e.g., dysfunctional personality traits, psychopathological symptoms, emotion dysregulation; Rozgonjuk et al., 2020; Spada et al., 2015). In recent years, the relationship between attachment and PSNSU has been receiving an increasing attention (D’Arienzo et al., 2019).  Attachment is a well-established psychological construct. It refers to an inborn motivation system that leads individuals to establish and maintain relationships with significant figures in their lives (Bifulco & Thomas, 2012), from the cradle to the grave (Bowlby, 1988). Attachment theory was first proposed by John Bowlby (1969/82, 1973, 1980, 1988) to describe emotional bonds between children and their primary caregiver; the theory was later extended to include close and intimate relationships in adolescence and adulthood (Hazan & Shaver, 1990; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2008).  Attachment was originally conceptualized as a relatively stable and consistent trait-like domain (Bowlby, 1969/82, 1973) that reflects individual’s systematic pattern of expectations, needs, emotions and social behaviors in close relationships (i.e., with parents and romantic partners; Schimmenti et al., 2021). According to this classical view, the internal working models of attachment (i.e., the affective and cognitive schemata including representations of self, other, and relationship between self and other; see Bowlby, 1973) develop during the first years of life within the parent-infant “dialogue” (Lyons-Ruth, 2006) and result in generally stable cognitive, emotional, and relational patterns.  Historically, Ainsworth et al. (1978) initially classified three major categories of attachment styles (i.e., secure, avoidant, and resistant/ambivalent), with later addition by Main and Solomon (1986) of the fourth category of disorganized attachment. Attachment styles are defined as the internalized mental representations of the self and others in close relationships (Cooper et al., 1998). Secure attachment arises from timely and consistent responses of caregivers to infant’s needs, which leads to a perception of significant others as accessible and trustworthy (Sroufe & Waters, 1977). In contrast, if caregivers are emotionally detached from their children and value children’s autonomy over affect communication, an avoidant style tends to develop. On the contrary, when caregivers provide inconsistent responses or persistently interfere with infant’s activity, the infant will form an anxious attachment style. Both avoidant and anxious attachment styles imply insecure, yet organized, internal working models of attachment: avoidant individuals tend to dismiss affect and display constraints on closeness, whereas anxious individuals tend to display excessive desire for company and fear of separation from significant others (Bifulco & Thomas, 2012). Disorganized attachment style, often observed in maltreated children, corresponds to a failure to integrate internal working models of attachment into a coherent and unitary structure (Benoit, 2004).  Bartholomew (1990; Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991) provided empirical support to the idea that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance are dimensional, rather than categorical, constructs, with attachment anxiety referring to the fear of rejection and abandonment, and attachment avoidance denoting a discomfort with being close to others and a compulsive self-reliance (Mikulincer et al., 2003). In such theoretical framework, the attachment styles result from the interaction between the dimensions of anxiety and avoidance: 1) secure (low anxiety and low avoidance), 2) preoccupied (high anxiety and low avoidance), 3) dismissing (low anxiety and high avoidance), and 4) fearful (high anxiety and high avoidance).  In addition, attachment theorists have distinguished between stable and context-dependent facets of attachment-related phenomena (Cozzarelli et al., 2000). This theory suggest that specific contexts and relational environment may evoke different approaches to close relationships, so that domains of anxiety and avoidance might be differently reflected in their specific contextual behaviors, beside the prototypical attachment style that usually organizes an individual’s affective life. Moreover, some scholars (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Gillath & Shaver, 2007) consider attachment as a state-like characteristic, whereby attachment to significant others depends on the specific life events and situations.  Therefore, for the purpose of the present study we distinguish between a general (or structural) model of attachment and a contextual model of attachment (Caron et al., 2012). The general model considers attachment as a trait-like characteristic that is relatively stable during the life span, i.e., an overall and consistent pattern of individual's thoughts, feelings and behaviors that is seen in all significant relationships, irrespective of the relational context (Fraley, 2002; McConnell & Moss, 2011). The contextual model posits that attachment-related phenomena are relationship-specific, with one person simultaneously exhibiting different attachments while interacting with multiple significant others (Caron et al., 2012; Cozzarelli et al., 2000; Kobak, 1994; Lewis, 1994).  It is noteworthy that a substantial amount of research has been conducted within the attachment framework. As a consequence, an elaborate terminology has been developed (Ross, 2004). In the present systematic review, we will use the locution “attachment-related phenomena” as an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of constructs, including secure, avoidant, resistant/ambivalent, preoccupied, dismissing, fearful attachment styles, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. Definitions of these concepts are provided in Table 1.  Considering the specific purpose of the current study, empirical research has demonstrated that attachment security is related to  Schematic representation of the attachment system.  adaptive coping strategies, including a lowered risk of engaging in problematic online behaviors (Estevez et al., 2019). In contrast, insecure attachment-related phenomena have been associated with problematic Internet use (Eichenberg et al., 2017; Monacis et al., 2017a; Schimmenti & Caretti, 2017; Schimmenti et al., 2014, 2021) and addictive-like behaviors more generally (Musetti et al. 2016b; Pace et al., 2013; Schimmenti et al., 2012; Schindler & Broning, 2015).  As SNSs are mostly used to establish and maintain online and offline relationships, an individual’s attachment may significantly affect the way in which these sites are used.  According to the compensatory model of Internet use (Kardefelt-Winther, 2014), PSNSU may be an attempt to cope with negative life situations, with use of SNSs compensating for psychosocial problems, such as low self-esteem, depression and loneliness (Benoit & DiTommaso, 2020; Shensa et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2017). Specifically, individuals with high attachment anxiety may rely excessively on SNSs in an attempt to alleviate painful emotions (e.g., fear of rejection or loneliness) and seek comfort and a sense of belongingness online (Costanzo et al., 2021). Individuals with high attachment avoidance, in contrast, may overuse SNSs and prefer them to actual interactions in the social world to maintain emotional distance with (and control over) others. Considering the developmental differences reported in the literature for both patterns of SNS use (Stockdale & Coyne, 2020) and attachment  (Theisen et al., 2018; Waters et al., 2000), research in this area has often examined adolescents and adult samples independently.  The relationships between attachment and PSNSU have been studied extensively. However, only a single systematic review has examined the associations between attachment and “social media addiction” (D’Arienzo et al., 2019). The inclusion criteria of that systematic review were very broad and encompassed studies of Internet addiction and both grey and scientific literature. Furthermore, D’Arienzo et al. (2019) only reported results of studies concerning the dimensions of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.  Therefore, the present study expands on D’Arienzo and colleagues’ (2019) review by including the following features:  These aspects of the present study may have crucial implications for efforts to prevent and alleviate PSNSU among youth and adults at the policy, institutional, social, and clinical levels.  This study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al., 2010). To ensure a thorough and transparent methodological procedure, the protocol for this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) data repository on January 2nd, 2021 (registration number: CRD42021224186).  The systematic literature search was initially conducted on December 12, 2020, by two authors (AM and TM). The literature search was then updated on June 17, 2021.  Articles were retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and PsycINFO web databases. The search strategy included a combination of the key elements identified to address the research question of this systematic review, with the Boolean operators AND/OR, and restricted within Titles, Abstract and Keywords.  The search string was: (“Attachment*“) AND (“social media” OR “social network*” OR “facebook” OR “twitter” OR “instagram” OR “snapchat”) AND (“problematic*” OR “pathologic*” OR “disorder*” OR “misus*” OR “overus*” OR “compulsive*” OR “excessive*” OR “addict*” OR “abus*“). No further filter was applied. Furthermore, the reference lists of relevant empirical articles and reviews were scrutinized to identify potential additional articles.  Studies were required to meet all of the following inclusion criteria (Ic):  Studies were excluded if they met one of the following exclusion criteria (EX):  All the papers collected through database searches were exported to  the systematic reviews web application Rayyan (https://rayyan.qcri. org/). After duplicates removal, two authors (AM and TM) independently assessed titles and abstracts to select the relevant studies. After this preliminary screening, results were compared and in case of disagreements, the two authors resolved them by consensus. Eligibility assessment was subsequently performed using full texts. All studies that met the inclusion criteria and did not meet any of the exclusion criteria were reviewed for data extraction (see Fig. 1).  The AXIS tool was employed in the analysis and assessment of the risk of bias in the final sample, which is critical for appraising the quality of observational and cross-sectional studies (Downes et al., 2016). The AXIS tool provides an overall quality assessment of each study and comprises 20 items which are scored as follows: Yes = 1, No = 0, and Don’t know = 0. The assessment includes study design, sample size justification, representativeness of the target population, sample selection, measurement validity and reliability, description of statistical methods and reporting of funding and conflicts of interest. A total quality score from 0 to 20 was assigned to each study, with scores being interpreted as follows (see Casale & Banchi, 2020): 0-7 points denotes a low-quality study, 8-14 suggests a medium quality study and 15-20 points means a high-quality study. The qualitative assessment outcome is presented in Table 4.  The extracted data were synthesized in the following domains: Author(s); Year; Document type; Location; Study design (e.g., crosssectional survey); Sample characteristics; Conceptualization of problematic SNS use; General and/or specific SNS problematic use (e.g., Facebook); SNS features; Measurement instruments for attachmentrelated phenomena; Type of attachment-related phenomena; Measurement instruments for PSNSU; Key findings.  After duplicate records were removed, 373 articles were considered. The examination of their titles and abstracts detected 84 studies that fit the inclusion criteria. After scrutinizing their full text, additional 52 papers were excluded, and 32 articles were retained and considered for our systematic review. Further information on the selection process and reasons for exclusion of studies is provided in Fig. 1 and Table S1.  Table 2 presents the main characteristics of the final sample, i.e., studies included in the systematic review. All 32 studies were crosssectional and were conducted in a total of 16,938 participants (M = 513.27), with sample sizes ranging from 100 to 2,758. The proportion of females was 64.31% (information not available for one sample), and individuals of both genders participated in all studies but one. The age of the participants across the studies ranged from 11 to 72 years (M = 20.51, SD = 6.07; information partial or unavailable for three samples). Fourteen studies were conducted in Europe (United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, France, Ireland), six studies were from East Asia (China, South Korea, Japan), three studies from North America (USA, Canada), Turkey and Australia each, two from Iran, and one from Tunisia. While 17 articles reported on generic SNSs, the remaining 15 articles focused on the specific social media platforms: Facebook (n = 12), Instagram (n = 2), and Grindr (n = 1).  The conceptualization of PSNSU and the corresponding terminology  Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the search strategy: Modified from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement flow diagram (Moher et al., 2010).  varied between studies. The majority of studies (n = 17) endorsed the addiction framework and used terms such as “social networking addiction” or “Facebook addiction”.  The full range of measures used in the studies, frequency of their use and assessed constructs are listed in Table 3. As many as 14 different instruments were employed for evaluating PSNSU. Thirteen studies used one of the Bergen Addiction Scales (i.e., the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale - BFAS [Andreassen et al., 2012]; the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale - BSMAS [Andreassen et al., 2016]; the Bergen Instagram Addiction Scale — BIAS [Ballarotto et al., 2021]), which appeared to be the most common tool for PSNSU assessment. Other frequently used instruments were the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS 2; Caplan, 2010) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT; Young, 1998), adapted for SNSs context.  The majority of studies (n = 24) endorsed a contextual model of attachment, while eight studies endorsed a general model of attachment. Attachment-related phenomena were assessed by means of nine different instruments, with the Experience in Close Relationships Scale (ECRS; Brennan et al., 1998; or adapted versions) used most frequently, in 11 studies. Other commonly applied measures were the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA; Armsden & Greenberg, 1987) and  the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ; Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991, or adapted versions), used in eight and six studies, respectively.  Quality assessment was conducted using the AXIS tool (Downes et al., 2016) and the related findings are displayed in Table 4. The scores for individual studies ranged from 9 to 19, with 14 studies scoring in the moderate range of quality and 18 studies scoring in the high range. The average score for all studies was 14.66 (SD = 2.22). Overall, the studies had clear research aims and their design was deemed appropriate (questions 1 and 2). However, the vast majority did not justify or adequately clarify their sample size based on previous experiments or a priori power estimates (question 3) and additional 22 studies did not address and categorize non-responders adequately (question 7). Outcome variables were correctly measured with psychometrically adequate instruments and were appropriate for the aims of the study (questions 8 and 9), but the adopted statistical procedures were not properly and sufficiently described in 18 studies (question 10). The discussion and conclusions were found to be justified in 29 studies by the obtained results (question 17) and the intrinsic limitations of the study  Studies on Problematic Social Networking Sites Use (PSNSU) and attachment included in the review (n = 32).     EEE IES Regarding parental attachment dimensions, trust towards parents was negatively associated to relapse (f = —0.50), withdrawal (f = —0.60), and conflict (f = —0.42); parental alienation was negatively associated with tolerance (8 = —0.40); communication with parents was positively linked with tolerance (fi = 0.48) and mood modification (f = 0.43) symptoms of Facebook addiction among early adolescents. Whereas, among adolescents, parental alienation was positively related with tolerance (B = 0.19), mood modification (6 = 0.19), and conflict (f = 0.15) symptoms of Facebook addiction.  Regarding peer attachment dimensions, trust towards peers was negatively associated with tolerance (f = —0.74) and mood modification (§ = —0.56); communication with peers was positively associated with salience ( = 0.20) among early adolescents. Whereas among adolescents, peer alienation was positively associated to all the six symptoms of Facebook addiction (salience: f = 0.19; tolerance: p 0.21; mood modification: f = 0.40; relapse: B = 0.29; withdrawal: B = 0.17; conflict: B = 0.27).                        ee Fearful, dismissive, secure, and anxious attachment styles did not reveal significant differences in SNS addiction. Attachment styles moderated the effects of SNS motives and SNS use on SNS addiction. Regarding SNS motives, dismissive (f = 0.32) and anxious (B = 0.24) attachment styles moderated the positive relationships between interpersonal utility motive and SNS addiction, and between informational utility and SNS addiction. Fearful attachment style (f = —0.21) moderated the relationship between pastime motive and SNS addiction. The positive association between time spent on SNSs and SNS addiction was moderated by secure ( = 0.38), fearful (B = 0.36), and anxious (§ = 0.20) attachment styles.

Attachment avoidance was positively associated with two facets of problematic Facebook use (i.e., B = 0.21 for impression management, f = 0.11 for intrusive social).  The positive association between attachment anxiety and problematic Facebook use facets (with the exception of emotional consequences of intrusive Facebook use) was partially mediated by psychological distress.

General model of attachment. The eight studies adopting the general model of attachment (i.e., attachment phenomena as trait-like domains or dimensions) found an overall positive association between attachment anxiety and PSNSU (A. Chen, 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Costanzo et al., 2021; Ershad & Aghajani, 2017; Monacis et al., 2017a, 2017b; Shafiee et al., 2020; Tobin & Graham, 2020). The association between attachment avoidance and PSNSU was positive in three of these studies (Chen et al., 2020; Ershad & Aghajani, 2017; Tobin & Graham, 2020) and negative in one study (Monacis et al., 2017a). Secure attachment style was found to be a negative predictor of PSNSU in two studies (Monacis et al., 2017a; 2017b), while disorganized and anxious (ie., preoccupied) attachment styles were positively associated with PSNSU in one study (Shafiee et al., 2020).  3.4.1.2. Contextual model of attachment. Concerning the studies adopting the contextual model of attachment (i.e., attachment phenomena as context-dependent and/or relation-dependent states), mixed results were observed. Different patterns of associations emerged depending on the relational context (i.e., parents, peers, and romantic  partners) and the developmental stage of the sample (i.e., adolescents or adults).  3.4,1.2.1. Studies of adolescents and young adults.  Seven studies with adolescents and young adults examined the relationships with parents. A high quality of the emotional bond with parents (Assuncao et al., 2017) and features of secure attachment to parents, such as high levels of perceived care and trust and good communication (Badenes-Ribera et al., 2019; Moreau et al., 2015), were negatively associated with PSNSU. Marino et al. (2019) found that PSNSU was negatively associated with high levels of trust and good communication in the relationship with the mother, but not in the relationship with the father. Similarly, Ballarotto et al. (2021) found that PSNSU was negatively associated with a secure attachment to the mother, but not to the father.  Several studies reported that features of insecure attachment to parents, such as maternal overprotection, inhibition of exploration, and high levels of separation anxiety with regards to parental figures, were positively associated with PSNSU (Assuncao et al., 2017; Assuncao & Matos, 2017; Chabrol et al., 2017; Marino et al., 2019). Badenes-Ribera et al. (2019) found that parental alienation (i-e., a general feature of insecure attachment) was negatively associated with PSNSU among younger adolescents (aged 12-13 years), while being positively associated with PSNSU among older adolescents (aged 14-17 years).  Measurement instruments and dimensions listed in the included studies (n = 32).     Table 3 (continued)  Studies examining the relationship between PSNSU and attachment in the context of peer relationships were only conducted in adolescents and young adult samples. Ballarotto et al. (2021) found that adolescents’ secure attachment to peers was negatively associated with PSNSU. Badenes-Ribera et al. (2019) reported that the attachment security dimension of trust toward peers among younger adolescents was negatively associated with PSNSU. Nasr et al. (2021) also found a negative association between PSNSU and the attachment security dimension of trust toward peers, but a positive association with the attachment security dimension of communication toward peers. Chabrol et al. (2017) and Moreau et al. (2015) found that secure attachment to peers was negatively associated with PSNSU in adolescent Facebook users with prominent borderline personality traits. Attachment insecurity (i.e., peer alienation) was positively associated with PSNSU among older adolescents, but not among younger adolescents (Badenes-Ribera et al., 2019).  3.4,1.2.2. Studies of adults. Attachment to partners and problematic social networking sites use.  Sixteen studies conducted in adult samples evaluated the relationship between PSNSU and adult attachment to romantic partners. Overall, higher levels of attachment anxiety were positively associated with PSNSU, while the pattern of associations between attachment avoidance and PSNSU was mixed - positive or negative, significant or nonsignificant, strong or weak (Blackwell et al., 2017; Flynn et al., 2018; Kyeong Lee, 2017; Liu & Ma, 2019a, 2019b; Vaillancourt-Morel et al., 2020; Worsley, Mansfield, & Corcoran, 2018; Worsley, McIntyre, et al., 2018; Young et al., 2020).  Regarding attachment styles, Baek et al. (2014) did not find significant differences between individuals with different attachments (i.e., fearful, dismissive, secure, and ambivalent) to their partners in terms of the association with PSNSU. Secure and dismissing attachment styles had a negative association with PSNSU (Eroglu, 2016), while the preoccupied style was directly and positively associated with PSNSU (Demircioglu & Goncii Kose, 2020; Eroglu, 2016). Furthermore, the fearful attachment style was positively associated with PSNSU in two studies (Demircioglu & GonciiKése, 2021). In young adults, PSNSU was positively predicted by the ambivalent attachment style, especially among females (Fujimori et al., 2015).  Seventeen factors were found to mediate the relationship between attachment and PSNSU. These include: (a) individual factors (i.e., borderline personality traits, self-directedness, self-esteem, psychological distress, psychopathological symptoms, maladaptive daydreaming, emotion dysregulation, metacognition, well-being); (b) interpersonal factors (i.e., peer alienation, relationship satisfaction, online social support, fear of missing out [FOMO]) (c) SNS-related factors (i.e., feedback sensitivity, likes-seeking behaviors, meeting one’s own psychological needs via Facebook use [i.e., needs for self-presentation, autonomy and relatedness]; and motivations [i.e., self-esteem enhancement and meeting the need for companionship] for SNS use).  3.4.2.1. Individual mediating factors. Borderline personality traits. Chabrol et al. (2017) identified borderline personality traits such as intolerance of loneliness and “heightened need for social relationships” as mediators of the positive relationship between maternal overprotection and PSNSU, especially in female individuals.        Self-directedness. Shafiee et al. (2020) found that low self-directedness (i.e., the ability to control, regulate, and adapt behavior to adaptively respond to situations according to one’s goals and values) mediated the positive relationship between disorganized attachment style and PSNSU.  Self-esteem. Demircioglu and Goncii Kose (2020) found that low self-esteem (i.e., the extent to which one values, approves, or likes oneself) partially mediated the positive link between preoccupied attachment style and PSNSU, while high self-esteem fully mediated the negative link between secure attachment style and PSNSU. Flynn et al. (2018) found that the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and different facets of PSNSU (i.e., social comparison, impression management, and impulsive/risky use) was partially mediated by low self-esteem.  Psychological distress. Flynn et al. (2018) found that the positive relationship between attachment avoidance and PSNSU facets (with the exception of engagement in self-disclosure on Facebook) was mediated by high levels of psychological distress (i.e., a state of emotional hardship that includes feelings associated with depression and anxiety).  Psychopathological symptoms. Ballarotto et al. (2021) found that the severity of adolescents’ current psychopathological symptoms (i.e., the score on the Symptom Checklist 90-R Global Severity Index) mediated the negative relationship between secure attachment to parents and peers and PSNSU.  Maladaptive daydreaming. Costanzo et al. (2021) found that prominent maladaptive daydreaming (i.e., a compulsive fantasy activity that interferes with interpersonal and social functioning) partly mediated the positive association between preoccupied attachment and PSNSU and fully mediated the positive relationship between fearful attachment and PSNSU.  Emotion dysregulation. Liu and Ma (2019b) found that difficulties in emotion regulation partly mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and PSNSU.  Metacognition. Marino et al. (2019) found that efficient metacognitive abilities (i.e., monitoring, evaluation, interpretation, and regulation of cognition; Spada & Marino, 2017) mediated the negative relationship between secure attachment and PSNSU, while a deficiency in metacognitive abilities mediated the positive relationship between insecure attachment and PSNSU.  Wellbeing. Worsley, Mansfield, and Corcoran (2018) found that attachment anxiety and PSNSU were positively associated through mediating effects of low levels of psychological wellbeing (i.e., the global level of self-acceptance, autonomy, purpose in life, positive relations with others, environmental mastery, and personal growth).  3.4.2.2. Interpersonal mediating factors. Peer alienation. Assuncao et al. (2017) reported that peer alienation (i.e., adolescents’ feelings of isolation, detachment from peers and anger towards them) mediated the positive association between several facets of insecure attachment to  Quality assessments and total scores using the AXIS tool (Downes et al., 2016).  Note. Y = Yes, N = No, na = Don’t know. * Items 13 and 19 are reverse coded. See Appendix for the AXIS tool questions.  parental figures (i.e., low quality of emotional bond, high levels of separation anxiety, and inhibition of exploration and individuality) and PSNSU among adolescents.  Relationship satisfaction. University students with a fearful attachment style were more likely to have low levels of relationship satisfaction (i.e., the extent to which one is satisfied with and happy and delighted about one’s relationship), which in turn was positively associated with PSNSU (Demircioglu & Géncii Kose, 2021).  Online social support. Liu and Ma (2019a) found that a high need for online social support (i.e., the support obtained via online settings) mediated the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and PSNSU.  Fear of missing out. Liu and Ma (2019a) and Boustead and Flack (2021) found that FOMO (i.e., the pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent) mediated the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and PSNSU.  3.4.2.3. Mediating factors related to social networking sites. Feedback sensitivity. Tobin and Graham (2020) found that high levels of feedback sensitivity (i.e., the responsiveness to the SNSs feedback systems) mediated the positive association between attachment anxiety and PSNSU.  Likes-seeking behaviors. Vaillancourt-Morel et al. (2020) found that a positive association between attachment anxiety and PSNSU was mediated by prominent likes-seeing behaviors (i.e., behaviors aimed at obtaining more Facebook “likes”). Moreover, prominent likes-seeing behaviors mediated the positive relationship between attachment avoidance and PSNSU, when attachment anxiety was low and attachment avoidance was high (i.e., in dismissing attachment style). On the contrary, the indirect association between attachment avoidance and PSNSU was negative, when attachment anxiety was high and attachment avoidance was high (i.e., in fearful attachment style).      Meeting psychological needs through SNSs use. A. Chen (2019) found that meeting the needs for self-presentation (i.e., individuals’ need to communicate their identity to others) and relatedness (i.e., individuals’ need to feel connected and interact with others) through Facebook mediated the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and PSNSU. Meeting the needs for self-presentation, relatedness and autonomy through Facebook mediated the negative relationship between attachment avoidance and PSNSU.  Motivations for SNSs use. Jayawardena et al. (2021) found that self-esteem enhancement (i.e., an improvement in the way a person evaluates himself/herself) and meeting the need for companionship (i. e., a desire not to be alone) as motivations for SNSs use mediated the positive association between attachment anxiety and PSNSU. Meeting the needs for communication and escapism as motivations for SNSs use mediated the positive association between attachment avoidance and PSNSU.  The present study aimed to systematically review and critically appraise existing research on the relationships between attachment and PSNSU. All studies contributed in specific ways to the elucidation of the associations between PSNSU and attachment. In line with the previous systematic review by D’Arienzo et al. (2019), our results showed that attachment anxiety was consistently and positively linked with PSNSU, whereas the results regarding attachment avoidance were mixed. However, we also found evidence that attachment security tends to protect from PSNSU. In addition, our review highlights that during adolescence the specific attachment contexts (e.g., relationship with parents or with peers) may differently affect PSNSU behaviors. Moreover, we also observed that factors at the intra-personal and interpersonal levels, as well as the way of using SNS, may mediate the  relationship between attachment variables and PSNSU. The study of mediators is critical for developing adequate prevention and clinical programs for PSNSU, but it is also relevant for improving the communication policies of SNS industries.  Researchers who used the general model of attachment reported an overall negative association between secure attachment and PSNSU and a positive association between insecure attachment and PSNSU, with very few exceptions. Consistent findings were reported with regards to the positive association between attachment anxiety and PSNSU, suggesting that the internal representations of self and others embedded in the relational dispositions of anxiously attached individuals may lead to an overuse of SNS. Attachment anxiety may thus promote an overinvolvement with SNSs as a dysfunctional way of coping with relational insecurities. Despite evidence is less strong for attachment avoidance, also in this case a positive association with PSNSU has been observed. In contrast, available evidence suggests that secure attachment (which involves a positive view of self and others, and also a balanced approach to relationships in the dialectic between dependency and autonomy) could constitute a protective factor against PSNSU.  The findings derived from the general model of attachment are thus consistent with the literature that considers insecure attachment as a risk factor for psychopathological symptoms (Schimmenti & Bifulco, 2015), including addictive online behaviors (Musetti et al., 2018; Schimmenti et al., 2014). Moreover, results are congruent with an interpretation of secure attachment as a fundamental factor underlying solid social, emotional, and cognitive skills (Baldwin et al., 1996).  To summarize, securely attached individuals may be more prone to use SNSs to reinforce solid offline relationships and thus meet their need for closeness and autonomy (e.g., by cultivating ties with close friends or partners; Oldmeadow et al., 2013). In contrast, the use of SNSs by anxiously attached individuals may temporarily alleviate their fear of rejection and abandonment (e.g., by compulsively seeking likes on their posts), but this can generate a vicious cycle that perpetuates excessive SNS use without mitigating attachment insecurity.  Researchers who used the contextual model of attachment showed that the relationships between PSNSU and attachment may vary depending on the specific interpersonal domain and the developmental stage of the SNS user. These findings are consistent with the view of attachment as sensitive to changes over age and experience (Chopik et al. 2012° Hudson et al. (2015).  et al., 2013; Hudson et al. (2015).  The present systematic review showed that in adolescents there was a more consistent association between insecure attachment and PSNSU in the context of the relationship with peers than in the context of the relationship with parents. This finding may be understood taking into consideration the developmental challenges that adolescents face as they emancipate from parents and achieve a sense of personal identity (Musetti et al. 2021a). During this developmental phase, social roles and relationships change dramatically as attachment to parents becomes more vulnerable and the influence of family on adolescent development decreases (Zou & Wu, 2020), while relationships with peers become more important (Kerr et al., 2003). Thus, the quality of the relationship with parents does not necessarily affect SNS use by adolescents (Duque et al., 2017) and may not be strongly related to PSNSU (Badenes-Ribera et al., 2019).  In accordance with the existing developmental literature which assumes a pivotal role of peer relationships during adolescence (e.g., Majorano et al., 2015; Musetti et al., 2020), variables reflecting peer alienation among adolescents and young adults were positively and consistently associated with PSNSU, while variables reflecting attachment security in peer relationships were generally negatively associated with PSNSU (Moreau et al., 2015; Oldmeadow et al., 2013).  It can be hypothesized that adolescents who established a secure attachment to parents during childhood tend to develop good interpersonal skills, which might be conducive to secure relationships with peers (Assuncao et al., 2017; Assungcao & Matos, 2017) and a more adaptive use of SNSs. It should not be overlooked that positive associations between good communication with peers (a feature of secure attachment) and PSNSU (Badenes-Ribera et al., 2019; Nasr et al., 2021) were observed. However, more specifically, Badenes-Ribera et al. (2019) found that good communication with peers was positively associated only with salience and mood modification features of PSNSU, which have previously been referred to as peripheral symptoms of PSNSU (Carbonell & Panova, 2017). Therefore, this association may reflect the high involvement in SNSs use, rather than a genuine addictive behavior, by adolescents as socializing tools for maintaining close bonds with peers (Antheunis et al., 2016).  In fact, most adolescents regard SNSs as essential tools for interacting with peers on a daily basis (Kwon et al., 2013). This calls for a balanced evaluation of SNSs use among adolescents and especially a need to avoid pathologizing normative behaviors and distinguish between a high involvement in SNSs use and PSNSU (Carbonell & Panova, 2017; Toth-Kirdaly et al., 2019).  With regards to studies that examined adult attachment with romantic partners, attachment anxiety was consistently and positively associated with PSNSU. This finding may be partly explained by a tendency by individuals who feel insecure in romantic or intimate relationships to use SNSs in a way that might alleviate their anxiety but ultimately lead to PSNSU. For example, such individuals may be more sensitive to the positive and negative comments to a post or to FOMO or may seek more “likes” and thereby spend an increasing amount of time using SNSs (Boustead & Flack, 2021; Liu & Ma, 2019a). In contrast, the associations between attachment avoidance and PSNSU were inconsistent (i.e., a positive association was found in five studies, a negative association was reported in three studies, and there was no association in three studies). This finding could be ascribed to several factors, including use of different assessment instruments (see section 3.2 and Table 3) and various meanings of the relationships with romantic partners (Oldmeadow et al., 2013). In addition, it may be that attachment avoidance is positively associated with PSNSU only in the context of high levels of attachment anxiety (Baek et al., 2014). Moreover, the construct of attachment avoidance itself includes at least two domains (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007): the first concerns derogating attitudes (i. e., relationships devalued and seen as secondary), while the second pertains to withdrawing attitudes (i.e., discomfort with closeness). It is possible that individuals with derogating attitudes may be less likely to develop PSNSU due to their excessive self-reliance and disinterest towards interpersonal relations. On the contrary, SNSs may be used by individuals with withdrawing attitudes as a way to develop and maintain connections with others, but at a safe distance (e.g., Vaillancourt-- Morel et al.. 2020).  Our results suggest that focusing only on the relationships between attachment and PSNSU provides partial information. Therefore,  examining the potential intervening factors in these relationships is critical.  Seventeen factors that our systematic review has identified as partial or full mediators of the relationships between various attachments and PSNSU can be construed as conferring additional risk for PSNSU, especially in the context of high levels of attachment anxiety. In this regard, the most frequently identified risk factors (n = 9) included individual variables, such as low self-esteem (Demircioglu & Goncii Kose, 2020; Flynn et al., 2018) and low well-being (Worsley, Mansfield, & Corcoran, 2018). As expected, attachment also influenced interpersonal domains, such as FOMO (Liu & Ma, 2019; Boustead & Flack, 2021), which in turn fostered PSNSU. Although less investigated, factors related to SNS use provided relevant insights on the specific online behaviors associated with PSNSU (e.g., self-esteem enhancement and meeting the need for companionship as motivations for SNS use (Jayawardena et al., 2021). Notably, no study reported non-significant mediation results. Overall, these findings suggest that the relationship between PSNSU and attachment is affected by different phenomena, such as users’ psychological functioning, their offline relationships, and their specific use of SNS.  Future interventions should strive to help individuals with personal and interpersonal insecurities adopt a more balanced self-esteem and improve social skills and coping (Marino et al., 2019). The mediating roles of prominent borderline traits (Chabrol et al., 2017) and high levels of emotion dysregulation (Liu & Ma, 2019b), feedback sensitivity (Tobin & Graham, 2020), and likes-seeking behaviors (Vaillancourt-Morel et al., 2020) in the relationships between various attachment-related phenomena and PSNSU call for interventions aimed at improving emotion regulation strategies and difficulties in interpersonal interactions. Disentangling the contribution of different categories of risk factors may play an important role in prevention of PSNSU, though future research is needed to establish this.  The findings of this systematic review have implications in the realm of a better understanding, prevention and treatment of PSNSU.  Examining attachment in individuals with PSNSU is important because it could help understand the developmental origins of PSNSU and contribute to identification of the underlying emotional and interpersonal needs and the associated behavioral patterns. A SNS user can develop PSNSU as a consequence of the generally high levels of attachment anxiety or in the context of the specific relational difficulties (e.g., with high levels of anxiety in the relationships with peers).  It is important to provide education to all the relevant stakeholders (e.g., teachers and parents) that maladaptive SNS use is strongly related to the person’s psychological functioning and that it calls for understanding — not an outright condemnation. Therefore, enhancing emotion regulation and self-actualization of people with PSNSU, especially adolescents, could be more useful than attempts to control SNS use externally. Furthermore, a secure relationship between parents and their children can promote a healthy SNS use, thereby preventing PSNSU. Educational interventions aimed at promoting secure attachment through emotionally responsive parenting during childhood and adolescence might help prevent PSNSU (Moretti et al., 2015; Tarabulsy et al., 2008).  Applying a process-based approach to clinical interventions (Kinderman et al., 2013), the specific individual, interpersonal, and SNS-related factors mediating the relationship between insecure attachment and PSNSU should be the major targets of tailored  psychological interventions (Billieux, Philippot, et al., 2015; Costanzo et al., 2021). Given that users may rely excessively on SNSs to cope with emotional and interpersonal difficulties (e.g., Musetti et al., 2021b; Ruggieri et al., 2020), metacognitive, socio-emotional learning programs (Durlak et al., 2011) and mentalizing practice (e.g., Lecointe et al., 2016) could be used to alleviate PSNSU symptoms.  Finally, our findings also have broader implications. Given that online and offline activities intersect and interact composing our living environment (Musetti & Corsano, 2018), health policies should be adapted to incorporate our understanding of technology-related human behavior derived from attachment research. This largely pertains to efforts to promote attachment security while people interact in the “digital environment”. For example, detrimental SNS behaviors, such as cyberbullying, should be strongly discouraged and actively suppressed because they undermine security in peer relationships, which can lead to other detrimental consequences, including PSNSU (Hussain et al., 2021). Similarly, there is evidence that online groomers, who use SNSs and other Internet platforms to seek contact and eventually abuse children and adolescents, select their victims also based on their attachment insecurities with parents and peers (Caretti et al., 2015; DeMarco et al., 2017). Promoting educational programs in schools to improve the quality of relationships also in the context of SNS use among youth might be crucial for avoiding some of the most deleterious outcomes of PSNSU.  The present systematic review has a number of limitations. Some result from the rapidly changing landscape of SNSs, which might have limited our “coverage” of the recently introduced SNSs. Another limitation relates to our search and selection procedure. Thus, some relevant studies might have been overlooked if PSNSU was encompassed by the broad terms “Internet addiction”, “problematic Internet use” or “Internet use disorder” (Kuss & Billieux, 2017). Also, we only included articles published in English, which precluded us from considering potentially relevant articles published in other languages. In addition, we did not investigate specific SNSs separately, since PSNSU refers to a general misuse of SNSs. An important limitation pertains to the nature of the included studies, because they all relied on self-reported measures (susceptible to response bias), had a cross-sectional design (precluding investigation of causality) and recruited self-selected participants who are not necessarily representative of the general population. Finally, the reviewed studies relied on different measures of attachment and PSNSU. Although such a variety of instruments might have shed more light on the complexity of the relationships between attachment and PSNSU, it has also made it more difficult to compare the findings between these studies.  Our systematic review presented an updated summary of the studies which investigated the links between PSNSU and specific attachmentrelated phenomena. High levels of attachment anxiety have consistently been associated with a greater severity of PSNSU, while inconsistent results regarding the relationship between attachment avoidance and PSNSU call for more research. Individuals with a generally insecure attachment may develop PSNSU because they are more likely to use SNSs as a dysfunctional way of coping in a variety of situations. Individual, interpersonal and SNS use-related factors seem to mediate the associations between insecure attachment and PSNSU. People with insecure attachment in the specific relational contexts may develop PSNSU because of poor coping with the vicissitudes of these specific relationships. A better understanding of the nature of attachment-related phenomena can help clinicians introduce tailored treatments of PSNSU.  Suggestions for future research include qualitative and longitudinal studies conducted in large and demographically diverse samples that would include individuals from more countries who belong to a greater range of age groups (e.g., older adults). Moreover, experimental studies with priming techniques (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2001) could be designed using attachment primes in relation to PSNSU stimuli or PSNSU primes in relation to attachment stimuli to contextually activate different patterns of associations between attachment and PSNSU. In addition, experiential sampling methods using a behavioral measurement of PSNSU (e.g., time spent on SNSs or number of published posts) would address the temporal and causal relations between attachment and PSNSU. Finally, future studies that concurrently analyze, different individual, interpersonal and SNS use-related factors in insecurely attached individuals who display PSNSU are warranted.  The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.  1 Were the aims/objectives of the study clear?
